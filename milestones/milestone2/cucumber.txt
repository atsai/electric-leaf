You can implement step definitions for undefined steps with these snippets:

Given /^I am at the main page$/ do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

When /^I click on the view debts button$/ do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

Then /^I should see a list of all roommates with associated debt amounts$/ do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

Given /^I am at the debt page$/ do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

When /^I click on a roommate name$/ do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

Then /^I should see the details of the debt$/ do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end
